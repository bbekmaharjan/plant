## Things that could've been done if more time was spent:

- Remove the unnecessary imports and assets.
- More GIT commits for better version control.
- Implement eslint for the code consistency and quality improvement.
- More decomposition of the components. (For example: productCards, questionItems).
- We can also use styling frameworks like tailwind/material-ui/bootstrap for faster styling.
- Instead of providing the github repositories, Figma design would be more practical to demonstrate the ease with languages and standards.
